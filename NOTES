* Supporting modules will probably be a massive PITA
* TODO: hide private symbols, put the visibility macros in utl_abi
* TODO: Maybe move all the type_traits builtins to a single file
* TODO: defined some sort of standardization for #if and #ifdef checks
* TODO: Find stable impementation of type traits introduced in C++20 and remove support for buggy implementations
* TODO: Maybe remove utl ordering and just use <compare>, the header is not particularly large
