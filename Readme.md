# Untitled Library (UTL)

Incredibly pointless library. Guranteed to compile at least 3 times slower than STL.

# Status
 * Untested at runtime
 * Untested on Windows/MSVC
 * Untested on Linux/BSD on GCC/CLang
 * Untested on x86
 * C++11 broken

# Disclaimer
This project contains undefined behaviours.
 * Forward declared std types if not using modules; if using modules, TBD.
